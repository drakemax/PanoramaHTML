# PanoramaHTML
This is setup used for Displaying Panoramas in a Browser(Images from 360 cameras).
It uses Jeremy Heleine's Photo Shere Viwer programme (https://photo-sphere-viewer.js.org/)
and uses Python to compile them into individual HTML files.

The intention is that the directory can be a stand alone directory so that all the executables 
and imnage files are located together so that they can be read from a PC, a USB, LAN or over the internet.
As the files are large (4-5Mb) its quicker with local access rather than over the web.

There are 2 posts about the process with demo's
